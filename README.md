Hello There!

My ambition is to use Artificial Intelligence for solving mass problems, which includes- social problems, climate problems, business problems etc. I have 2 years of experience with AI/ML projects (Personal) and still learning. I believe in practical learning and thus I am open to any opportunity in this specific field. Especially interested in opportunities that include NLP, Computer Vision, or Natural TTS.

I want to get to know people who are working with AI/ML/DL in companies and learn from their experiences. Because I believe that experience is the best teacher of all. Though I am at the Undergrad level, I do not want to be judged by degree level. I am more than my degree. If you are looking for someone who is really passionate about AI and who can learn things very fast then I am that person. If you are willing to hire a person for his enthusiasm, then I am willing to learn about your ways of implementing AI and can assure you of your desired output.

Besides that, I am the founder of a social linking organization called "Bondhon". We are connecting all social organizations under a single platform so that getting help becomes easier. Connectivity is the strongest weapon. If social organizations become united, then the whole world will see the power of pure hearts. No one should be deprived of being helped.
